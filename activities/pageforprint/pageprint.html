            <h3>
                Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h3>
            <p>
                The viewport mega tag allows for responsiveness on mobile devices. The viewport mega tag tells your mobile browser not to shrink your webpage down and allows your webpage to remain the normal size
            </p>
            <h3>
                How can you adjust the CSS for printing?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You would create a new css file and when you link it in you will change the media query to fit the needs of which css file to use for viewing the webpage versus which css file to use for printing the webpage.

            </p>
            <h3>
                When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You would only want to adjust the CSS for printing when you would know that someone would want to print out your page.

            <h2>Questions for October 27th, 2025</h2>
            <h3>
                Why do we need a viewport meta tag?
            </h3>
            <p>
               We need a viewport meta tag in order for our page to work on a mobile device.
 
            </p>
            <h3>
              When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The most recent instruction given to the tag would take priority.
            </p>
            <h3>How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can create a media tag in CSS that creates a customized screen for widths that are particular to phones or smaller devices.
