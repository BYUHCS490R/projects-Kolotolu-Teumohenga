        <h2>List out the different ways to select an item</h2>
        <p >You can select by using the tag name in your CSS document. If you want to be more specific as to which section of the document you want to effect, you would use the descendant rule which chooses a specific location such as header, footer, body, etc to make modifications to.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p>ID uses a hashtag while class uses a period. With ID you can only use a name once else it will create a vaildation error while you can use a name as many times as you want with the class attribute.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p>The div requires it's only line whereas the span tag doesn't</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>The DIV tag is a container without a specific meaning while the header main and footer convey meaning to the structure of your content.</p>
        <h2>What are the different ways to select a color?</h2>
        <p>The RGB model, alpha, hughes-saturation luminoscity, and hex codes.</p>
