        <h2>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h2>
        <p>
            Some examples of negatives would be ads, content control limits, and user dependence on Youtube rather than your own site. Some examples of positives would be not having to pay for hosting large videos, reaching a bigger audience and youtube analytics to measure engagement of users.
