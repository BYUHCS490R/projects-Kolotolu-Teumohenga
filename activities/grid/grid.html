            <h2>Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.</h2>
            <p>The children is main content that you are focusing on that is often held within a tag aka the parent. An example can be seen above where the paragraph tags are children to the parent main tag.</p>
            <h2>What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
            <p>Grid is two dimensional while flex is one-dimensional. Grid has columns and rows while flex is either horizontal or vertical. Flex is more fluid across layouts. Grid is very strict and whatever the parent communicates to the child goes.</p>
