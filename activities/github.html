    <p>The DOCTYPE tag helps the server know what document type you are using. The html lang tag lets the server know what language your document is in to enable translation of the page into different languages. The tags between the "head" opening and closing tags are attributes that describe your page. Using the "Title" allows you to name the title of your tab and does not appear on the actual page. Between the opening and closing "body" tags is the  area where you can write the things that you want to show up on your page.</p>
