    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network of connected computers and devices that form a foundational structure of communication. The internet allows users all around the world to access and exchange information, services and resources.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The web is a system of documents and multimedia that are connected through links and accessible through web browsers using the internet. The web allows users to view pages that have text, images, video, etc. and they can be navigated using hyperlinks.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and the Web diffferent?</h2>
    <p>The internet is more about the physical hardware, connectivity and protocols whereas the web is a service or software layer of documents that are interlinked and accessible via the internet.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". ASCII is standard of character encoding which represents English letters, punctuation, digits, etc. using numeric codes. An example of this standard code is that the letter 'A' would be the number '65' in ASCII.</p>
    <p>Unicode is a character encoding standard that is universal. Unicode was designed to cover characters and symbols for typically every language written in the world. There are several differenct encoding forms which can support over 140,000 characters and the first 128 characters in Unicode are the same as the characters defined by ASCII. This allows for greater compatability</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit." UTF-8 is the most commonly used and efficient character encoding standard. UTF-8 uses one to four bytes which is 8-bit units. This allows common characters like those in ASCII to be encoded in one byte. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is space-efficient and supports all languages.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator." It is a unique address that is used to identify and locate specific resources on the internet. Some examples are web pages, images, files, etc. The URL acts like a web address for browsers to display and retrieve content from web servers.</p>
    <h2>Domain name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is a memorable, human-readable address that is used to identify a specific resource or location on the Internet. There are different levels of domains, top-level, such as .com, .org, etc., second-level, which  represents the organization or website name, and third-level, a subdomain that designates a specific service such as www. which stands for "World Wide Web." </p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." HTTP is a protocol that governs the communication between web browsers and web servers in their loading and transferring of web content through request-response messaging on the Internet.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS also known as "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure" is an extension of HTTP. HTTPS adds a layer of encryption allowing for more secure communication between a web browser and web server.</p>
    <h2>IP address</h2>
    <p>IP addresses are unique numerical identifiers that are assigned to each device that connects to a computer network. IP stands for Internet Protocol which is a set of rules that defines how data packets are sent from a source device to a destination device. IP addresses function similar to a postal address enabling devices to send and receive data across local networks and the internet. It specifies where data should go and where it came from.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS stands for "Domain Name System" and is similar to a phonebook, but for the internet. It translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. Computers can then use those IP addresses to locate and communicate with each other on the network.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>W3C Recommendations are formal rules and guidelines set by the "World Wide Web Consortium." W3C is an international organization founded by the inventor of the web in 1994, Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHtML, HTML, HTML 5</h2>
    <p>XML stands for, "Extensible Markup Language." It is a general markup language designed for data storage and transport. XML enforces strict syntax.</p>
    <p>XHTML stands for, "Extensible Hypertext Markup Language,." XHtML is basically HTML that is rewritten to comply with XML standards. It ensures strict syntax and increased compatibility.</p>
    <p>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language." This is the foundational markup language for web pages. It is more lax on the syntax than XML and XHTML.</p>
    <p>HTML5 stands for "HyperText Markup Language version 5." HTML5 builds upon HTML and has new features. It provides optional syntax similar to XML called XHTML5. HTML5 is modernized in web development and supports both multimedia and application features.</p>
