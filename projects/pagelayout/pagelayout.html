            <p>Jesus Christ was often referred to as the "Good Shepherd". A quote that portrays this title wonderfully in 3 Nephi 18:30 of the Book of Mormon says, "...for behold, I know my sheep, and they are numbered." Not only is it important that Jesus Christ knows us, but it is vitally important for us to know and recognize Him.</p>
            <p>Another verse from the Book of Mormon in Alma 5:38 reads, "I say unto you that the food shepherd doth call you, yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ...if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd...ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd. It is important that we take steps towards deepening our relationship with Christ, if we want to be able to recognize His voice calling out to us.
