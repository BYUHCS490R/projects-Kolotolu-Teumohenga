        <h1>My Interest - Temples</h1>
        <h2>What are temples?</h2>
        <p>Temples are the house of the Lord. Every temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the inscription "Holiness to the Lord; The House of the Lord." In the temple, worthy and willing members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have the opportunity to make further covenants, a two-way promise, with God for themselves as well as for their ancestors. It is important to note that when members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make promises with God in behalf of their ancestors or other deceased individuals that those individuals are able to choose whether or not they want to agree to such a promise. </p>
        <h2>Blessings of the temple</h2>
        <p>Another beautiful blessing of the temple is the opportunity for families to be sealed together with God's power, making a covenant that enables them to be together forever. I love to go to the temple because it always brings me joy and peace whenever I feel overloaded with tasks and assignments or problems with loved ones. Most importantly, the temple can help us center our focus on Savior, who is the reliever of our burdens and the answer to all of our earnest questions of life.</p>
