        <h1>My Hero - The Brother of Jared</h1>
        <p>The brother of Jared is a an individual whose story is shared in the Book of Mormon, specifically the Book of Ether. The brother of Jared was known to be highly favored of the Lord and he had the faith to ask the Lork questions that those around hesitated to ask. There is a section in the book of Ether where the  brother of Jared was chastened by the Lord for not inquiring of Him for an extended period of time. Despite being chastened by the Lord, rather than hardening his heart, the brother of Jared repents and proceeded to diligently heed the Lords commands. Eventually, his diligent faith led to him being able to see Jesus Christ as well as the unfolding of the mysteries of God. The brother of Jared is a wonderul example of humility, obedience and faith in Jesus Christ. His example leads me to become more like my Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
