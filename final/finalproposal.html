        <h1>Final Proposal</h1>
        <h2>
            The title and topic of your page.
        </h2>
        <p>
             The title of my website will be “Teumohenga Concrete Construction.” The topic of my site will be my dad's construction business.
        </p>
        <h2>
            A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I chose this project because ever since I was younger my dad had always joked to us about wanting us to make him a website for his company. He usually gets jobs through referrals from previous customers but since the world is evolving towards technology, people typically search up concrete businesses on google rather than looking asking for referrals to concrete businesses. I want to create this website to try and help him with his business.
        </p>
        <h2>
            List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Driveways and Sidewalks info page with price comparison tables</li>
            <li>Foundations and plumbing patchwork page with price comparison tables</li>

        <h2>
            What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The form page will invite the user to sign up for a free concrete estimate. The data listed on the table will compare the company's concrete prices to other concrete rates in Arizona.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.
